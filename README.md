Land-Atmosphere Interactions Model (LAIM)
by John Chun-Han Lin (John.Lin@utah.edu)

Simple 1-D model of the land and the atmosphere in order to study the coupling and interactions.
The LAIM model adopts numerous simplifications/assumptions as part of its “spherical cow” approach:
•	No horizontal fluxes and horizontal advection
•	Variations within mixed-layer is minimal
•	Variations within thin surface layer neglected
•	Inversion layer in the entrainment zone represented by a “jump”
